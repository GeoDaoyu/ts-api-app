# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to `dojo1-typings`.

## Reporting Bugs

For things that you think might be bugs, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dojo/typings/issues/new?body=Description:%0A%0ASteps+to+reproduce:%0A%0A1.%20%E2%80%A6%0A2.%20%E2%80%A6%0A3.%20%E2%80%A6%0A%0AExpected%20result:%0AActual%20result:%0A%0AVersion:%0A%0AAny%20additional%20information:).

## Feature Requests

For feature requests, just open an issue in GitHub.  We will consider your suggestion and evaluate if we think it is feasible and within reason.  It is even better if you feel like you can try to contribute by adding the feature; just submit a pull request by following the section below. WOO HOO! :smile:

## Submitting Pull Requests

We care a lot about Open Source.  One of the most important things is to make sure every contribution is given freely by its owner.  Therefore we require every contribution to have a [CLA](http://dojofoundation.org/about/claForm) on file.  This CLA covers contributions to [many open source projects](http://dojofoundation.org/projects/), so it won't be a wasted 30 seconds of your life and there are no blood samples taken!!!

All contributions should adhere to our [linting rules](tslint.json) and should follow the structure of the whole repository.  If you are unsure of how to contribute, just ask. Otherwise we will get grumpy :angry:, and you won't like us when we are grumpy. :sob:

## Again, Thank You!

Not only do you want to contribute, you read the guidelines! We :heart: you!
